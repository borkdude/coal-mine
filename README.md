# Coal Mine

A large corpus of compiler characterization tests derived from submissions by 
the top 1000 users on [4Clojure](http://www.4clojure.com), made to work with ClojureScript.

This is useful for regression testing compiler patches. Since the codebase is large, 
it is also useful for testing compiler performance.

The `coal-mine.test-runner` namespace facilitates running all of the tests under ClojureScript.
